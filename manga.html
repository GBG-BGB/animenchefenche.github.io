                  <p>Manga are comics or graphic novels originating from Japan. Most manga conform to a style developed in Japan in the late 19th century, though the art form has a long prehistory in earlier Japanese art.The term manga is used in Japan to refer to both comics and cartooning. Outside Japan, the word is typically used to refer to comics originally published in the country. <br><br>
                    In Japan, people of all ages read manga. The medium includes works in a broad range of genres: action, adventure, business and commerce, comedy, detective, drama, historical, horror, mystery, romance, science fiction and fantasy, erotica (hentai), sports and games, and suspense, among others. <br><br> Many manga are translated into other languages.Since the 1950s, manga has become an increasingly major part of the Japanese publishing industry.By 1995, the manga market in Japan was valued at ¥586.4 billion ($6–7 billion),with annual sales of 1.9 billion manga books and manga magazines in Japan (equivalent to 15 issues per person). <br><br> Manga have also gained a significant worldwide audience.In 2008, in the U.S. and Canada, the manga market was valued at $175 million. Manga represented 38% of the French comics market in 2005, equivalent to approximately ten times that of the United States, and was valued at about €460 million ($569 million).In Europe and the Middle East, the market was valued at $250 million in 2012.</p>

                    The word "manga" comes from the Japanese word 漫画,composed of the two kanji 漫 (man) meaning "whimsical or impromptu" and 画 (ga) meaning "pictures".The same term is the root of the Korean word for comics, "manhwa", and the Chinese word "manhua".
<br><br>
The word first came into common usage in the late 18th century with the publication of such works as Santō Kyōden's picturebook Shiji no yukikai (1798), and in the early 19th century with such works as Aikawa Minwa's Manga hyakujo (1814) and the celebrated Hokusai Manga books (1814–1834)containing assorted drawings from the sketchbooks of the famous ukiyo-e artist Hokusai.<br><br> Rakuten Kitazawa (1876–1955) first used the word "manga" in the modern sense.

                    Manga magazines usually have many series running concurrently with approximately 20–40 pages allocated to each series per issue. Other magazines such as the anime fandom magazine Newtype featured single chapters within their monthly periodicals. <br><br>Other magazines like Nakayoshi feature many stories written by many different artists; these magazines, or "anthology magazines", as they are also known (colloquially "phone books"), are usually printed on low-quality newsprint and can be anywhere from 200 to more than 850 pages thick. Manga magazines also contain one-shot comics and various four-panel yonkoma (equivalent to comic strips). Manga series can run for many years if they are successful.<br><br> Manga artists sometimes start out with a few "one-shot" manga projects just to try to get their name out. If these are successful and receive good reviews, they are continued. Magazines often have a short life.

                    After a series has run for a while, publishers often collect the episodes together and print them in dedicated book-sized volumes, called tankōbon.<br><br> These can be hardcover, or more usually softcover books, and are the equivalent of U.S. trade paperbacks or graphic novels. These volumes often use higher-quality paper, and are useful to those who want to "catch up" with a series so they can follow it in the magazines or if they find the cost of the weeklies or monthlies to be prohibitive.<br><br> "Deluxe" versions have also been printed as readers have gotten older and the need for something special grew. Old manga have also been reprinted using somewhat lesser quality paper and sold for 100 yen (about $1 U.S. dollar) each to compete with the used book market.

                    Dōjinshi, produced by small publishers outside of the mainstream commercial market, resemble in their publishing small-press independently published comic books in the United States.<br><br> Comiket, the largest comic book convention in the world with around 500,000 visitors gathering over three days, is devoted to dōjinshi.<br><br> While they most often contain original stories, many are parodies of or include characters from popular manga and anime series. Some dōjinshi continue with a series' story or write an entirely new one using its characters, much like fan fiction.<br><br> In 2007, dōjinshi sales amounted to 27.73 billion yen (US$245 million).In 2006 they represented about a tenth of manga books and magazines sales.

                    While webtoons have caught on in popularity as a new medium for comics in Asia, Japan has been slow to adopt webtoons as the traditional format and print publication still dominate the way manga is created and consumed. <br><br>Despite this, one of the biggest webtoon publishers in the world, Comico, has had success in the traditional Japanese manga market. Comico was launched by NHN Japan, the Japanese subsidiary of Korean company, NHN Entertainment. As of now, there are only two webtoon publishers that publish Japanese webtoons: Comico and Naver Webtoon (under the name XOY in Japan).<br><br> Kakao has also had success by offering licensed manga and translated Korean webtoons with their service Piccoma. All three companies credit their success to the webtoon pay model where users can purchase each chapter individually instead of having to buy the whole book while also offering some chapters for free for a period of time allowing anyone to read a whole series for free if they wait long enough.The added benefit of having all of their titles in color and some with special animations and effects have also helped them succeed.<br><br> Some popular Japanese webtoons have also gotten anime adaptations and print releases, the most notable being ReLIFE and Recovery of an MMO Junkie.

                    A number of artists in the United States have drawn comics and cartoons influenced by manga. As an early example, Vernon Grant drew manga-influenced comics while living in Japan in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Others include Frank Miller's mid-1980s Ronin, Adam Warren and Toren Smith's 1988 The Dirty Pair, Ben Dunn's 1987 Ninja High School and Manga Shi 2000 from Crusade Comics (1997).
<br><br>
By the 21st century several U.S. manga publishers had begun to produce work by U.S. artists under the broad marketing-label of manga In 2002 I.C. Entertainment, formerly Studio Ironcat and now out of business, launched a series of manga by U.S. artists called Amerimanga.In 2004 eigoMANGA launched the Rumble Pak and Sakura Pakk anthology series.<br><br> Seven Seas Entertainment followed suit with World Manga.Simultaneously, TokyoPop introduced original English-language manga (OEL manga) later renamed Global Manga.
